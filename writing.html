**On Lucidity**

**Prompt**: _Remind me to write lucid English since I tend to forget its importance in thinking._

**Answer:**  Quality writing reflects a thoughtfulness toward three questions asked early and often.

1. Who's the audience?
2. What's the problem?
2. What's the thrust?

Audience comes first because they determine the relevance of the problem and thrust. Since the first member of the audience is yourself, write on what you know and care about. A first draft just has to establish the scene, escalate to a conflict, and propose a solution. 

Material comes from having problems. 
Interest in a technical craft will help.
The prolific mathematician Terry Tao [blogs because](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/) it forces him to work through an argument or idea, making it accessible for future use. 
Software developer Julia Evans [suggests](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/05/24/blog-about-what-you-ve-struggled-with/) writing about your struggles.

Every project is a beast with peculiar problems, and you must think well to find the thrust of the solution. 
All writing advice says is that the [virtues of thought](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/twelve-virtues-of-rationality) drive the words.
In doubt, return to simplicity, says Seneca, responding to the trap and trappings of rhetoric:


> Moreover, speech that aims at the truth should be unaffected and plain. This popular style of speaking has nothing to do with truth; it seeks to stir the crowd, to steal upon unguarded ears and carry them by storm. It does not expose itself to scrutiny, but is off at once. But how can speech supply us with discipline if it is itself undisciplined? Bear in mind that that this kind of speech, which is intended to bring healing to the mind, has to get deep inside us. Remedies that do not stay in the system cannot be effective.[^seneca]

Simple and plain speech squeezes viable and logical thought, that is, lucidity. After simplicity comes the [virtues](https://theamericanscholar.org/writing-english-as-a-second-language/) of clarity, brevity, and humanity. People still watch Shakespeare's plays because the language is cheesecake -- dense, complex, but made of this kind of basic stuff.

Speaking of, befriend the English language.
Old English was brought to the bard's island by Anglo-Saxon invaders from Germany around 450 AD and modernized 600 years later by absorbing the language of French conquerors. 
It's a two-in-one deal, which gives you options in vocabulary. 
Prefer the peasant's older Saxon to the scholar's French when you want to be vivid. 

Learn to make an abstract concept concrete with a choice metaphor or simile, but also develop an eye and ear for contrast because there are times for complexity, ambiguity, digression, and inhumanity. 
Some philosophy needs radical, labored language to make the familiar fresh or the unknown visible.
Polonius has to be long-winded for comedic effect.

Writing is highly technical, but the sorcerer's apprentice can find of plenty of spells at the local library. Whether limber or muscular, lyric or direct, a good sentence is bottled magic. Compare the punctuation of Cormac McCarthy with Nietzsche's [style](https://www.openculture.com/2022/02/nietzsches-10-rules-for-writing-with-style.html). Cast the spell by reading it aloud, just as you should read aloud your own work. Keep your discarded sentences for future use. 


All that to say, you're in the audience, the prompt is the problem, and the thrust is this:

> "Whatever is well conceived is clearly said, and the words to say it flow with ease."
>           -- Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux
