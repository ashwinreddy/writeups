**Literature as Technology**
    [Ashwin Reddy](https://ashwinreddy.github.io/)


_**Washington, D.C. 1814**_. A fire sparked by British troops incinerates the books housed in the nascent Library of Congress. Inflamed, former president Thomas Jefferson offers to sell Congress his private collection of six thousand books accumulated over fifty years. The largest collection in the fledgeling federation of states owes its size to its curator's "canine appetite for reading" and belief that democracy requires citizens properly educated in many fields:

> Ancient history, Modern history (Foreign, British, and American), Ecclesiastical history, Natural Philosophy, Agriculture, Chemistry, Surgery, Medicine, Anatomy, Zoology, Botany, Mineralogy, Technical arts, Ethics, Religion, Equity, Law (Common, Mercantile, Maritime, Ecclesiastical, and Foreign), Politics, Commerce, Arithmetic, Geometry, Mechanics (and Statistics, Pneumatics, Phonics, and Optics), Astronomy, Geography, Gardening, Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Poetry (Epic, Romance, Tragedy, Comedy, Dramatic, and Didactic), Oratory, Criticism, and Polygraphical (books covering several categories) -- [Source](https://www.masshist.org/thomasjeffersonpapers/catalog1783/)
> 

The loss of so vast a library leaves a hole in Jefferson's heart, so the only way forward for the bibliomaniac is to start his collection anew. Ever scrupulous, he [specifies](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-08-02-0464-0001#TJ922606_5REF) the works, authors, and editions he wants to recover first. They are selections from the [western canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_canon), in particular the masterpieces of ancient Greek and Latin, [including](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-11-02-0343) Homer, Virgil, Juvenal, Aeschylus and Tacitus. The choice reflects Jefferson's classical training, common to the formally educated of the Founding Fathers, and he prefers to read these authors in their original language over translations.

For in the Jeffersonian view, reading is a necessary luxury. It is a matter of civic engagement, public welfare, and practical skill to read a wide variety of disciplines as well as a recreation to read classical and subsequently influenced European texts. Certainly, it is useful to carve out a structured reading from the greater sea of books, and Jefferson is within his rights to focus on the Greeks and the Romans, for the ancients maintain a profound influence on us even today. But Jefferson is also a slave-owning aristocratic man who suggests we read books from long-gone civilizations. We are also within our rights when we ask if his method holds up.

# _Wissenschaft_

Since Jefferson's time, the Library of Congress has grown many orders of magnitude, now 39 million books strong. Immediately, we are confronted with two consequences.

1. Nobody can hope to read even an appreciable fraction of these books.
2. The books vary greatly in quality.

Hardly shocking premises, but they create a conundrum. To know with certainty a book is worth reading, we have to read it, but reading takes time, an implicit assent of worth. We don't want to miss out on a good book, simultaneously we have to be picky. To escape the loop is to recognize there's no surefire way to pick the right book. We can only make informed decisions and learn from our mistakes.

The good news is twofold. First, reading is not a binary activity such that we have either read or not read the whole book. We can skim or examine only relevant chapters, and so put in less time for a book of lesser quality and more time for a book of higher quality. Francis Bacon describes both the observation of different forms of reading and the resultant strategy best:

> Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. 
> 

Second, only a minority of books warrant our diligence and attention. In statistical terms, book sales follow a Pareto distribution, whose shape is shown in Figure [Power]. The appeal to book sales should not be understood as equating the value of a book with the revenue it generates. It's a heuristic, a general rule of thumb, which in this case eliminates from consideration books that almost nobody has bought. Simply put, a book without a readership is unlikely to benefit us.

![Figure [Power]: Plot of a power-law distribution, which includes the Pareto. Most of the area under the curve comes from the relatively small band in green. The Pareto distributions capture the 80-20 rule, where 80% of the output comes from 20% of the input (the actual numbers depend on the situation).](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Long_tail.svg)

The second piece of good news comes with a twist, though. Hidden inside the Pareto distribution is a cycle. When the lifetime of an object follows a Pareto distribution, the Lindy effect kicks in (see Appendix for mathematical proof). 

[Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)
: The longer the object has been around, the longer, proportionally, it will continue to stick around, on average.

On this view, books enter a marketplace that ranks them by value or quality. The dynamic in the marketplace is king-of-the-hill, if we believe the Pareto distribution. At any given time, only a handful of books will be dominant. When a new book enters the marketplace, it competes with them for attention. When the occasional book gains traction, it sells more, more copies are printed, it persists longer, people hear about it and read it more. Plus, the older it gets, the more respect it earns. A classic is a book that completes the brutal struggle to the top of the hill, and the canon is the set of books that made it.

This model has obvious problems.

- If we only select by age or sales, then our decision is 100% driven by the market, a noisy signal.
- It's not obvious when a book has finally reached the status of classic.
- The oldest/best-selling books do not by themselves form a coherent, trustworthy, or respected reading program.

The end we seek is _Wissenschaft_, a German word meaning systematic understanding, encompassing the humanities, arts, and sciences. Specifying our desiderata more precisely and in line with this vision yields Jeffrey Brenzel's [five criteria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVLpdzhcU0g) for a classic.

|Criterion/Desideratum|Benefit|
|---------------------|--------|
|Addresses permanent & universal human concerns|A perenially relevant book is one you can always return to.|
|Game-changer|It doesn't just repeat information you knew. This book is the first time anyone seriously articulated _X_, _Y_, or _Z_.|
|Influences other works|You can discover more classics just by reading them. They form a natural progression.|
|Respected by experts|Not necessarily a sign of correctness, rather it indicates there is knowledge in this book you should know because it captures what people were thinking at the time.|
|Challenging yet rewarding|A classic will reward you for even a minimal amout of time put in, and it will force you to improve your reading skills.|

# _Deus Ex Machina_

Jorge Luis Borges understood the madness induced by the deluge of books. In his 1941 short story "The Library of Babel," he imagines an expansive library that contains all books of 410 pages. The librarians realize that some of the books must contain truth unadulterated. Some, believing ordinary languages insufficient to transmit universal knowledge, try to uncover the theoretical language of the true books. Others go around the library and eliminate the books they see as worthless. Another group thinks there is a Book-Man who has found one book which is a compendium of all the other books. 

In short, the story examines the faults of reading the output of mass media as if it were scripture. The library collects information without any prioritization, ordering, or hierarchy. In this regard, it is like reading the internet without a search engine or just browsing a stack of newspapers or magazines. But the possibility that truth lies somewhere in the library compels the librarians to treat nonsensical books as scripture.

Scripture is seen as divine, universal, and true. It commands respect and careful treatment from adherents, who employ a whole ecology of reading practices. Historically, you see the early Christians take up the role of editors when they compile the New Testament, and Christian monks painstakingly copying and producing manuscripts. In the same time period, the practice of _lectio divina_ emerges. One reads, meditates, prays, and contemplates a passage of scripture in order to digest it. The Protestant Reformation will start to place greater emphasis on the word of the bible since the schism separates Protestants from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. 

A religious culture that believes in the word of god thus becames a literate culture, with an extended memory and the ability to concentrate on a train of thought for long stretches of time. It also creates a culture that believes the rational understanding of god can be found by making sense of the laws of nature. The Gutenberg press acts as a multiplier on these effects, but it also increases the need for a canon -- if deciding what goes into the New Testament is hard, then deciding what to read in a hyperproductive literary world is Herculean.

At the end of the day, the canon is a technology dressed up in religious clothing. It solves the problem of determining what is valuable to read and what is not. As technology, _canon_ literally means measuring stick, and the canon is just as primitive and useful. It's a list of good books that has expanded over time. As often, the simple solution is the one that sticks around. That it is slow to change is both its advantage and disadvantage. The best works of the canon are truly timeless, but they are not tailored to our world's problems, our mood and taste.

# Experiments

The holy ghost of scripture lingers when teachers assign essays involving the close reading of a passage. Ostensibly a secular activity, the technique of close reading developed by the New Critics makes literature the object of scientific inquiry. It assumes the text is a formal, aesthetic object that stands on its own and emphasizes the careful interpretation of words in a passage over authorial intent or the reader's response. 

To do a close reading is to devote time and energy and attention, and it only makes sense if we think the text is fundamentally true. Susan Sontag notes in "Against Interpretation" that interpretation is a clever solution to a scriptural problem.

> Interpretation is a radical strategy for conserving an old text, which is thought too precious to repudiate, by revamping it. The interpreter, without actually erasing or rewriting the text, is altering it. But he can’t admit to doing this. He claims to be only making it intelligible, by disclosing its true meaning.
> 

No wonder that my friends and I felt that such essays were elaborate time sinks. We were concocting false problems to solve in texts we did not find inspiring in what is just a variation of the _lectio divina_.

The worst offender of this practice is the Freudian literary critic. In _Anti-Oedipus_, French philosopher Gilles Deleuze and co-signer Felix Guattari critique the Oedipal complex, which Freud and followers use to interpret the dreams of their patients. The patient internalizes the interpreted dream, which tells them what they desire and controls how they think and act. But Freudian readings are hardly scientific, as Karl Popper points out. Is there a better way to think about reading a book?

Deleuze returns that question with another. What if instead of treating the text as a specimen or a symptom, we use it as a laboratory? 

> There are, you see, two ways of reading a book: you either see it as a box with something inside and start looking for what it signifies, and then if you're even more perverse or depraved you set off after signifiers. And you treat the next book like a box contained in the first or containing it. And you annotate and interpret and question, and write a book about the book, and so on and on. Or there's the other way: you see the book as a little non-signifying machine, and the only question is "Does it work, and how does it work?" How does it work for you? If it doesn't work, if nothing comes through, you try another book. This second way of reading's intensive: something comes through or it doesn't. There's nothing to explain, nothing to understand, nothing to interpret. It's like plugging in to an electric circuit.

The practice of reading ought to yield practical insight. Jefferson and Deleuze would both agree to that. If reading is experimentation, then this is our theory of reading:

1. The expert reader is also an amateur -- one who is enamored. [Read what you love until you love to read](https://nav.al/love-read) and heed Roosevelt's [words](https://www.artofmanliness.com/living/reading/teddy-roosevelts-advice-on-reading/): _A book must be interesting to the particular reader at that particular time_.
2. Accept that there are more books than you can possibly read by [starting many books and finishing few of them](https://collabfund.com/blog/how-to-read-lots-of-inputs-and-a-strong-filter/). 
    - **Corollary**: Never feel bad for dropping a book. 
3. When you are new to a field or don't know what to read, look to the standard classics in that field. 
    - Use Table [Brenzel] as a checklist.
4. Develop your own personal canon of classics. This the measuring stick by which you measure your own reading progress.
5. Return to your classics often. 
    - It is better to understand a few good books well than many bad books poorly. 
6. Listen to Vladimir Nabokov.
    - The four things a good reader needs are imagination, memory, a dictionary, and some artistic sense.
    - The first read of a book is just to take it all in. Books, properly speaking, can only be reread.
5. When you do finish a book or sense that there is something deeper, give it the scrutiny it deserves. Ask these questions, courtesy of Mortimer Adler.
    1. What is the book about as a whole?
    2. What is being said in detail, and how?
    3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
    4. What of it?
7. Read broadly and don't be afraid to combine insights across disciplines for truth knows no such limits.
9. Stay humble about what you don't know. Umberto Eco and Nassim Taleb advocate a  bookshelf which includes books that one has not yet read about subjects one does not know much about.

(#) Appendix

The survival function $S(t)$ tells us the proportion of books that will last longer than $t$ time.

$$
S(t) = \begin{cases} \left(\frac{t_m}{t}\right)^\alpha & t \geqslant t_m \\ 1 & t < t_m \end{cases},
$$

where $t_m$ is the minimum amount of time a book can exist and $\alpha$ is a parameter which describes how uneven the distribution is (bigger is more uneven). For $T \sim \mathsf{Pareto}(t_m, \alpha)$, we want to compute $\mathbb{E}[T - t_0 \mid T > t_0]$, how long the book will continue to last if it has already lasted for time $t_0 > t_m$.

\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[T - t_0 \mid T > t_0] &= -t_0 + \int_{t_m}^\infty t \cdot f(t \mid t > t_0 ) \,\mathrm{d}t  \\
&=  -t_0 + \frac{1}{S(t_0)} \int_{t_0}^\infty t \cdot f(t) \,\mathrm{d}t \\
&= -t_0 + \left(\frac{t_0}{t_m}\right)^\alpha \int_{t_0}^\infty t\cdot \alpha \frac{t_m^\alpha}{t^{\alpha + 1}}\,\mathrm{d}t \\
&= -t_0 + \alpha \left(\frac{t_0}{t_m}\right)^\alpha t_m^\alpha \int_{t_0}^\infty \frac{1}{t^{\alpha}}\,\mathrm{d}t \\
&= -t_0 + \alpha t_0^\alpha  \frac{t_0^{1-\alpha}}{\alpha -1} \\
&= \frac{t_0}{\alpha - 1 } \\
\end{align*}
