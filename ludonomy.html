**Ludonomy**
    Ashwin Reddy

The ancients took games seriously, perhaps more seriously than us, giving them a venerated place in their stories and rituals. After RagnarÃ¶k, the Nordics say, the new gods will find artifacts in the grass -- pieces of the chesslike board game Tafl, remainders of an extinguished world. Or, in a critical moment of India's _Mahabharata_, the longest extant epic poem, the Pandavas lose their kingdom and all their possessions in a rigged game of dice, thus setting the main story in motion. Even today, the Olympics serve as a reminder that the Greeks once celebrated the name Zeus with athletic contests.

Suppose that hoping to recover old ideals, we believe games still matter. It's not so ridiculous once you remember that animals play, too. But assuming life _is_ a game, so what? Is that a cause for joy or despair? Is life a rat race? Is it the hero's journey where we navigate the labyrinth and confront a Minotaur? Or is it a Sisyphean task? Perhaps a cold and calculated chess match, or the opposite -- a game of snakes and ladders? Does the modern world even agree whether the point of a game is to win or have fun? 

A useful metaphor must ground its tenor in a more concrete vehicle. But games are hardly easier to understand than life itself, so the comparison wins us nothing. _Life is a game_ is an enervated aphorism which needs an essay to investigate and invigorate it.

# Define

> "That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: "tell her something about the games now."
>                                                                           -- Lewis Carroll's _Alice in Wonderland_

Without a definition of games, we are liable to talk past one another, but I do not claim an indisputable definition. The point is to bind the word to an agreed meaning. After that, I am free to use the word liberally and with impunity.

Game
: A game $G$ consists in $n \geqslant 1$ players $\left\{P_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$ in a space $S$, each attempting to reach their personal goal state(s) $\Omega_{P_i}(G) \subset S$ while following rules which determine the shape of $S$, all for fun.

The definition splits into three components. The Ablation column below lists what a game would be without that component.

|Component|Key Phrase|Ablation|
|---------|----------|---------|
|Agency|_players ... each attempting to reach_|Event|
|Goal|_their personal goal state(s)_ $\Omega_{P_i}(G)$|Toy/Sandbox|
|Restrictions/Playfulness|_following rules which determine the shape of $S$ all for fun_|Activity|
[Table [components]: The ingredients of a game]

A game needs players empowered to make choices. If they lack agency, they can't make choices that dramatically shift the game's course. Then the players are not players but beings experiencing an event like a graduation ceremony or an acid trip. 

The players need a goal $\Omega(G)$, a privileged state in $S$ to reach. The $\Omega(G)$ for chess is checkmate. But the goal need not be a static arrangement of objects in $S$. It might be a mental state as in _Clue_, where the $\Omega(G)$ is knowing the details of the murder. Or it can be a physical space, like sumo wrestlers trying to stay inside the dohyo as long as possible. The $\Omega(G)$ is keeping the game going as long as possible in last-man-standing or so-called infinite games. If the player decides on his or her own goals, then the game is a toy or a sandbox like Legos.

Finally, a game needs restrictions, rules or constraints, which impose limits on $S$ but in turn open up the possibility of play. Notably, players have to affirm these rules on their own terms. Moving a bulky sofa into a new apartment is an activity that affords agency and has a goal, but it is not a game. The constraints are defined purely by the circumstances. You can't simply drag the sofa through the door because the door is not wide enough, not because there are rules which are preventing you from doing so. In contrast, the chess ruleset prevents its players from moving pieces however they like, and players subscribe to these rules for no other reason than to play chess.

Thus, we cover chess, crossword puzzles, ultimate frisbee, video games, and the rest of the litany.


# Telos

Definitions can't explain, and this one says nothing about the reasonable but misguided question _why do people play games?_ We'll need to introduce the notion of telos as well as instincts and institutions to reframe the question.

The telos of an object is its end or purpose. The telos of a knife is to cut. The telos of a seed is to turn into a plant. It is true that the telos of players in a single episode (i.e. one round or match) of a game is to reach $\Omega(G)$. But the telos of the game as a whole cannot be $\Omega(G)$. If it were, why would we have rules preventing us from getting there? Instead, the game has to help players find the experience rewarding. 

To see what's going on here, it's helpful to lean on Gilles Deleuze's distinction between instincts and institutions. An instinct directly satisfies some tendency or need of an organism. The form of the instinct depends both on that particular organism's biological state (is it hungry? is it sad?) as well as the species (bats use echolocation, but cows can't). The institution is a socially sanctioned method for satisfying a tendency or need. But the institution always introduces new, effectively arbitrary, undertakings:

> So money will liberate you from hunger, provided you have money; and marriage will spare you from searching out a partner, though it subjects you to other tasks.
>

Humans are animals that replace their instincts with institutions, which gives them a model for understanding the world through a refined though distorted lens. 

The game is an institution whose telos is to satisfy the need for play by giving us other tasks to work on. But play itself is an autotelic instinct. If a player seeks money or status or extrinsic reward, they degrade the game to activity -- a chore or labor or a means to an end. If this distinction seems straightforward, then we should wonder why it has confused so many. In "What's the Point If We Can't Have Fun?" David Graeber [notes](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun) that thinking in terms of capitalist economies and evolutionary fitness makes us confused about why animals play. If so, we've got the logic backwards. We should care _more_ about games because the players expend resources on something that has no obvious benefit to their survival. Play is important, even vital to nature, and we will leave it there. 

The question isn't _why do people play games_ but rather _where does play show up in games_?

We have created a definition that emphasizes the structure of games. But it is impoverished in that it talks about play as merely a structural constraint. Where is the sense that the players yearn for play?[^defn] Rather than directly grappling with play, we will consider a game that fits the current definition, then one that doesn't, at least not as well. In attempting to unite the two kinds of games, we will have a more holistic sense for the sacred syllable _game_. 

[^defn]: Defining play won't answer the question. [#Feezell10] gives us the sense that it is protean, at once a behavior or activity; a motive, attitude, or state of mind; a form or structure; and a meaningful experience.


# Solve

Optimization problems are a well-understood class of game in mathematics which offers insight into the structure of games. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:opt}
\min_{x \in X} f(x) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad  \Big\{ g_i(x) \leq 0 \Big\}_{i=1}^n
\end{equation}

The player $P_1$ is the puzzle-solver. The space $S$ is given as $X$. The goal $\Omega(G)$ is that you have a value for the minimum $x$, and the rules are you must satisfy the $g_i$ and only use mathematically valid steps to obtain this number such that you can prove its correctness.

In its naked form, Equation \ref{eq:opt} does not look like a game, but it perfectly describes, say, a running race. The equation there is minimum time = maximum speed, optimization at its purest. Behind every game is an Equation \ref{eq:opt}. But typically the goals, constraints, and players change in an intricate dance which cannot ever be put into symbols.

In fact, the symbols of Equation \ref{eq:opt} bury the game's landscape. Stephen Wolfram [shows](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/games-and-puzzles-as-multicomputational-systems/) that even simple games like Tic Tac Toe exist inside an intricately structured space:

![Figure [multiway]: Wolfram's visualizations of the state spaces of simple games, demonstrating that games are computational systems.](https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/multiway-hero-final-2.png)


Wolfram focuses on games with discrete state spaces and moves. For such games, the natural visualization is a graph. Each vertex is a state and the edges represent moves from one state to another. If the game has a continuous state space, however, the better description is a manifold. 

The best example of a manifold is Earth, whose surface I can traverse continuously.[^dimensions] Just as an atlas in real life is a book of charts that allow me to navigate the earth, every manifold $M$ has a mathematical structure called an atlas $\mathscr{A}$, which contains charts $\varphi_\alpha$ that cover all of $M$. 

[^dimensions]: The Earth's surface is an example of a 2-dimensional manifold because you need sheets of paper as the charts. A 1D manifold has number lines for charts, and a 3D manifold has cubes for charts, so on and so forth; you can have manifolds in $n$ dimensions for any integer $n \geqslant 1$.


$$
\mathscr{A} = \left\{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha): \alpha \in I\right\} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha = M
$$

A chart $\varphi$ takes some portion of $M$, denoted $U$, and gives it coordinates in $\mathbf{R}^n$, which are easier to work with. For Earth, $U$ could be the region of France, and $\varphi$ would assign latitude and longitude to all the points in $U$.

![Figure [earth]: Earth as a manifold, with one chart shown. Notice the flat geometry of the chart compared to the curved geometry on the surface. With enough charts, we could cover the whole surface.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Triangle_on_globe.jpg)

Critically, players don't need to keep the whole manifold in their memory to play. As long as they know where they are and where the goal is, they can make progress, tracing out just one of many possible paths in the space of the manifold.

![Figure [path]: A path on the manifold of your screen.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Path.svg)

Path
: A trajectory in the manifold, represented by a function $f: [0, 1] \to M$. If $M$ is a graph, then a sequence of edges connecting vertices on the graph.

In this vocabulary, a game provides a manifold on which players trace out paths that aim to terminate in $\Omega(G)$. A succesful path is a solution to the game.

Solution
: A path that ends at $\Omega(G)$ while obeying all the constraints.

All this formalization makes solving a game simple.

1. Enumerate or represent all possible paths
2. Select the one which is optimal by some algorithm or heuristic. 

Problem solving is all about thinking in this way. For example, working backwards is finding a path by traversing from $\Omega(G)$. 

A more powerful example is Lagrangian mechanics, where we model a physical system as a game. The player is Mother Nature,[^gt] and the space is a manifold called the configuration space, which represents a physical system (e.g. mass on a spring, blocks on a ramp, etc.). We impose the following condition on Nature: at time $t_0$ the system must be in the configuration $\mathbf{q}_0$ and at time $t_1$ it must be in configuration $\mathbf{q}_1$. 

[^gt]: This is a standard practice in game theory. We say that we're modeling Nature as a pseudo-player, and the actions are called moves by Nature.

![Figure [solutions]: A homotopy of paths $\mathbf{q}(t)$ that start at $\mathbf{q}_1$ and end at $\Omega(G)$. The player, i.e. Nature, needs to select the optimal one.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Homotopy_between_two_paths.svg)

The laws of physics -- the word law should make you think of ludonomy here -- make only some paths possible, but which one does Nature select? She selects the optimal one as defined by

$$
\frac{\delta S}{\delta \mathbf{q}(t)} = 0, \tag{Hamilton's Principle}
$$

where this equation is analogous to finding an optimum for a function $f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$ by solving $f'(x)=0$. The quantity $S$ is called the action and it tracks the total excess energy $\mathcal{L}$, known as the Lagrangian, over the time interval.

$$
S[\mathbf{q}] \triangleq \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \mathcal{L}\big(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t)\big) \, \mathrm{d}t.
$$

A standard technique in the toolkit of physicists, Lagrangian mechanics is an application of Equation \ref{eq:opt}. The upshot is that thinking in terms of optimization and search problems in a space is a practical tool in the world. 

Another example goes back to Wolfram's discrete setting. In the Tower of Hanoi problem, there are three rods with a stack of disks on the rightmost rod organized from smallest to largest going down. Your job is to transfer the disks to the leftmost rod, one disk at a time, but without ever putting a larger disk on top of a smaller one. 

![Figure [Hanoi]: The Tower of Hanoi, a classic problem from introductory computer science classes. ](https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw060722hanoiimg3.png)

We can generate the solution using recursion to avoid creating the whole graph.

```Python
def printMove(fr, to):
    print(f'move from {fr} to {to}')

def towers(n, fr, to, spare):
    if n == 1:
        printMove(fr, to)
    else:
        towers(n - 1, fr, spare, to)
        towers(1, fr, to, spare)
        towers(n - 1, spare, to, fr)
```
[Listing [Recursion]: Python program to compute Hanoi solutions recursively.]

In all these examples, we clearly specified a game, then computed ready-to-go solutions using problem solving techniques and reasoning. The paths are guaranteed to end at $\Omega(G)$. In the best case, we can solve a game completely.

Solved game
: A game for which we can produce solutions from any position.

Only after formalizing the game can we submit it to our will like this. We need a word to refer to a game's mathematical structure so we can identify this possibility.

Ludonomy[^ety-ludonomy]
: The game as it appears when expressed through logical propositions, symbols in algebra, or as a geometric object, enabling it to be represented and solved mathematically.

Ludonomers are logicians, computer scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and lawyers, fluent in the rules (and the implications) of a game. 

Remember this about ludonomy, if nothing else: it is where we take up the mantle of Shiva and by solving games, put them to rest. This is remarkable but also bittersweet. If the game is solved, then people will stop playing it. Adults know how to force a draw in Tic Tac Toe, hence only children play it. But new games emerge where old ones are buried. We go on to construct games for which we must become better, faster, stronger.

[^ety-ludonomy]: Formed from Latin _ludus_ meaning game and Greek _nomos_ meaning law, custom, or rule.

# Language

> "Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses."
>                               -- Wittgenstein

Perhaps no mathematician loved games and play as much as Lewis Carroll, author of _Alice in Wonderland_ (1865) and its sequel _Through the Looking-Glass_ (1871). When he wasn't writing about Euclidean geometry and logic or finding recursive ways to compute determinants, he was writing poetry and novels and designing puzzles.

In _Through the Looking-Glass_, Humpty Dumpty unknowingly reveals to Alice that conversations are turn-based games.

> "In that case we start fresh,â said Humpty Dumpty, 
> âand itâs my turn to choose a subjectââ (âHe talks about it just as if it was a game!â thought Alice.)
>                                                   

Alice stops short of calling the conversation a game, but we can supply the syllogism for her. In a conversation, two or more players are operating in the space either of ideas or words. They have agency insofar as they can say something which will advance the conversation, that is, move it in some direction. The goal is to keep the conversation engaging for all players as long as they can. There must be rules because you cannot just say anything in a conversation, and Paul Grice tells us what they are.

|Maxim|Directive|Meaning|
|----|---------|--------|
|Quantity|Be informative|Say as much as you need but no more than that.|
|Quality|Be truthful|Don't say what is false or lacking in reason.|
|Relation|Be relevant|Stay on topic.|
|Manner|Be clear|Be brief and orderly; avoid ambiguity and obscurity.|
[Table [Grice]: Grice's Maxims tell us four principles that (good) conversationalists follow.]

We showed that a conversation has Ludonomy, but it shares almost no similarities with the examples in sec. [Solve]. The path of a conversation is completely abstract and can't be reasonably represented in a mathematical structure. Consequently, I can't point to an $\Omega(G)$ in that space nor can I predict what you would say or where the conversation will go. In short, there's no solution to a conversation. To play it is to experience it. Therefore, any conception of games relying solely on ludonomy is insufficient. There must be another side to games which can capture the gamelike aspect of conversation. 

Ludwig Wittgenstein coined the term _Sprachspiel_ (German for language-game) in his book _Philosophical Investigations_ to talk about such games, which include

> 
> - Giving order ands obeying them
> - Describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements
> - Constructing an object from a description (a drawing)
> - Reporting an event
> - Speculating about an event
> - Forming and testing a hypothesis
> - Presenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams
> - Making up a story; and reading it
> - Play-acting
> - Singing catches
> - Guessing riddles
> - Making a joke; telling it
> - Solving a problem in practical arithmetic
> - Translating from one language to another
> - Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.
>

To unify Ludonomy and _Sprachspiel_, we need a common basis. However, _Sprachspiele_ resist a simple mathematical structure. We can take the reverse approach: force mathematics into language.

Take chess, a ludonomous game. I can write down a particular game as a series of moves in the algebraic notation. If I had a sheet with these moves to someone, they might tell me who the players were, or why such and such move was noteworthy. What this tells me is that the notation concisely captures the information of the game. Every game has a _Sprachspiel_, which spectators and commentators are the first to notice, but the more ludonomous the game, the more the formalization does the work rather than the spectator.

Despite the fact that chess is so rigorously structured, different players have different styles, and the meta-game has changed over time. This is another way in which every game has _Sprachspiel_. Since players have agency, they can express their personality in their choices in and approach to the game. 

# Academics

|Ludonomy|_Sprachspiel_|
|--------|--------------|
|Ludonomy is the enclosed institution of the game with a clear goal. It requires concentration and careful analysis of rules. It sees the game as a puzzle and wants us to use our mind and learning to uncover the structure and come to an objective answer. It wants everything laid out in a hierarchical manner so that we, the players, can see what its purpose is and then exploit its advantages. Once we see all things in a stable coherence, we can find the optimal trajectory and simply follow it.|_Sprachspiel_ is about the outward-looking instinct and language of play. It wants to feel how the world is laid out over time and space, not to comprehend it in one gulp. It wanders around the space, hoping to see what is curious and interesting, what defies expectation. It orients itself towards the aesthetic. It asks whether a thing has a use which hasn't been considered yet. It like intuition and creating new things out of old ones. The _Sprachspieler_ digs for Pluto's sparkling gems in the earthy soil.|

Every game has a Ludonomy which persists while we sense there are rules, and a _Sprachspiel_ which enables the game to be an institution and not just the fancy of an individual. However, different games are positioned at different points on the spectrum between the two. In particular, we focus here on the disciplines of _Wissenschaft_, collective knowledge.

*                                     
****************************************************************

We draw a box for Ludonomy because it can swallow games and an arrow for _Sprachspiel_ because it can extend indefinitely. 

Each discipline is a game that provides its own frame for seeing and understanding its subject matter. On its own, we can doubt what it has to tell us. A typical philosophy paper can't and won't bring in a mathematical perspective. A work of art usually doesn't do the science it references justice. But the principle of consilience tells us that if fields with different operating assumptions and techniques converge on the same conclusions, we should believe that conclusion more. 

## Math

> "Mathematics is a game played according to certain simple rules with meaningless marks on paper"
>                                                                       -- David Hilbert

Technical papers in pure mathematics are a sequence of definitions, lemmas, theorems, and proofs. They leave you to develop the intuition; the paper's purpose is to lay out the facts. Heavy on Ludonomy and light on _Sprachspiel_, math still needs language to communicate. Grice's Maxims are always in play: the paper needs to say something interesting, relevant, and informative in a clear way. And one needs a sense of adventure and curiosity in mathematics as well. 

## Science

Science pursues explanations in the natural world, or what amounts to the same, discovering the rules of Nature's game. Given observations of how the game has turned out, can we say what the Ludonomy of the game is? Richard Feynman found games a natural metaphor for science:

> "There are a number of special techniques associated with the game of making observations,
> and much of what is called the philosophy of science is concerned with a discussion of these techniques.
> The interpretation of a result is an example. To take a trivial instance, there is a famous joke about a man
> who complains to a friend of a mysterious phenomenon. The white horses on his farm eat more than the black horses.
> He worries about this and cannot understand it, until his friend suggests that maybe he has more white horses than black ones."
>                                                                                   

On the one hand, Wittgenstein says speculating about an event and dealing with hypotheses are _Sprachspiel_. The farmer is also clearly communicating with his friend to interpret the results. On the other hand, the basic inference (more white horses -> white horses eat more) is a trivial example of Ludonomy. 

The explanations in science ought to follow Grice's maxims as well: they should be interesting, relevant, informative, and clear. One paper which tries to tether the Ludonomy and _Sprachspiel_ of explanations is [#Wojtowicz20]. 

## Philosophy

> "[Philosophy] forms and constructs the mind, lays down life, rules actions, shows what is to be done and what is to be left out, it sits at the helm and directs the course through the uncertainties of hesitating." 
>                           -- Seneca

A serious discussion about what philosophy is would take up a book of its own. All that must be said is that philosophy's tendency toward logic and uncovering the structure of things pulls it toward Ludonomy while its conversational and creative nature pushes it toward _Sprachspiel_. If we want to prevent ourselves from minimizing its value, we need to stop ourselves from allowing it to slip all the way to Ludonomy. The goal of philosophy is not to create a totalizing framework in which everything is given a narrow purpose. Rather, philosophy has to invent concepts and tell us what games are worth playing as well as how to play them. 

## Art

> "Regarding truths, the artist has a weaker morality than the thinker. He definitely does not want to be deprived of the splendid and profound interpretations of life, and he resists sober, simple methods and results."
>                       -- Nietzsche

By art, I mean creating art, understanding it, and critiquing it, whether it be writing, drawing, painting, sculpting, singing, etc. Of course, we see a great sense of play in Picasso and Dali. We love artists who revolutionize the game around their own style. Undoubtedly, artists have the agency to put elements together on the canvas, in the marble, or whatever their medium is. The goal of a piece of art is never clear, but the artist must bind themselves to _some_ rules to create something meaningful and sensible. 

Understanding and critiquing art is also a game. Reading a literary book or watching a cinematic movie is a game because you have to choose how to take in what you're seeing. If you skip to the end of the book or movie, you didn't "win." The point is to follow a path in the space of imagination. In some sense, this path is fixed because the concrete materials of the artwork don't change. But the experience of the path _is_ different for different viewers. There are better and worst readers and viewers depending on how well they make sense of and use that experience and can convey it to others.  

# Chaos Emerges

Mathematicians, scientists, philosophers, and artists are not working on the same problems they were a hundred years ago. If they are, the problems changed when it reached their hands, either because (a) through some form of Ludonomy, we solved or resolved them, or (b) they failed to inspire interest any longer. 

Can we say something about what makes a game interesting? Yes, if we learn the language of emergence, chaos, and entropy.

According to Assad and Packard, emergence is when a system like a game shows behavior that could not have been predicted from the rules. The bigger the gap between the formal rules, the Ludonomy, and the behavior of the system in the wild (_Sprachspiel_), the more "emergent." For example, biological organisms are emergent because it's hard to deduce that amino acids could give rise to life. 

|Category|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|Non-emergent|Behavior is immediately deducible upon inspection of the specification or rules generating it.|
|Weakly emergent|Behavior is deducible in hindsight from the specification after observing the behavior.|
|Strongly emergent|Behavior is deducible in theory, but its elucidation is prohibitively difficult.|
|Maximally emergent|Behavior is impossible to deduce from the specification.|
[Table [Emergence]: Scales of emergence.]

If you've ever played a board game with complicated rules but began to see and enjoy the strategy after playing for a few rounds, you have experienced emergence. The rules were abstract, so you couldn't see that they actually led you to make compelling choices.

Emergence focuses on the structure of the game, but chaos and entropy can help us see the behavior inside the game space. Chaos theory is a technical field examining deterministic systems which exhibit local predictability with long-term unpredictability. Take a double pendulum.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Double-compound-pendulum.gif)

It moves smoothly, as you would expect. But the path it traces out is unpredictable, even at a mathematical level. Despite having the equations -- you can even write them out using a Lagrangian as in sec. [Solve] -- there's no way to compute the real motion without simulating it step by step. In this way, chaos theorists have found that math, the ultimate Ludonomy, undermines its own capabilities in some instances.

When Shannon defined entropy in 1948, he was thinking about telecommunication systems. He saw that to design these systems, the important aspect, crudely put, was how surprised a receiver would be to see a given message. Entropy was the measure of this surprise. The more random the information, the more surprised you would be. Shannon's information entropy spread into a number of areas, including statistics, where the principle of maximum entropy was discovered.

Principle of maximum entropy
: If you have many possible models for a system, select the one which has the highest entropy.

To use a model which has lower entropy is to pretend you know what's surprising and what's not.

A concrete example is in order. Let's take stories. A story with minimal entropy is one which you could have predicted from beginning to end. That is, it conveyed little information. But that doesn't mean the best story is a dream where characters and events pop in and out of the narrative with seemingly no pattern. That's a high entropy story, but it isn't interesting. There's some sweet spot where you can see that a story could go in multiple ways or has multiple possible meanings. That is, there's a high entropy but it's constrained by the information you already have and your guesses about the future. This theory doesn't help us generate new rules of storytelling, but it does explain why we don't like a _deus ex machina_. It's not a device you can predict, given the past information of the story. A good story is one where the information flows together, but it ends up somewhere interesting, remarkable, _unexpected_.

Academics puts an emphasis on Ludonomy, which we desperately need. It's important also to be humble about what we know and acknowledge that a healthy amount of uncertainty is necessary for play. In _Black Swan_ and _Antifragile_, Nassim Taleb makes space for the family of disorder we're talking about, which includes

> uncertainty; variability; imperfect, incomplete knowledge; chance; chaos; volatility; disorder; entropy; time; the unknown; randomness; turmoil; stressor; error; dispersion of outcomes; unknowledge
> 


# Autonomous Intelligence

Play is at the core of the academic disciplines, or so I argue. Then perhaps the kernel of intelligence is play. Where do Ludonomy and _Sprachspiel_ come in?

The position paper by machine learning researcher [#Ma22] focuses on two values that autonomous intelligence (AI) must express, which I believe correspond to our own binary categories.

Parsimony is a difficult word which needs a vivid image.

The Cartographers Guild are the Ludonomers, hoping to create a complete manifold. But, as Borges points out, such a manifold is useless because it doesn't focus our attention. The job of a map is to simplify the world so we can navigate. That's parsimony. 

Borges short story "The Library of Babel" also pokes a hole in a Ludonomic way of thinking. The story concerns a library with all possible books in it, and the various librarians who seek truth inside this collection of mostly gibberish characters. The point, as I see it, is that truth doesn't belong to the medium we put our representations in. It's in the _Sprachspiel_ between us, whose milestones are recorded for safekeeping.


In his series [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ), John Vervaeke discusses the same dichotomy in the language of cognitive science and philosophy. Vervaeke thinks in terms of what he calls Relevance Realization. While humans are amazing at Ludonomy, solving problems and seeing underlying structures in things, a lot of this happen unconsciously. It's possible for us to fixate on the wrong thing, frame the problem the wrong way, not exploring possibilities outside the stories we tell ourselves. Yes, we need ludonomy to intellectualize and solve problems. But we also need _Sprachspiel_ to discover what else might be relevant. We can't survive without both. 

I'm hopeful that papers like [#Lampinen21] and [#Liu22] will continue to come out and show that AI systems do better when they incorporate language-based explanations (a _Sprachspiel_) in their learning algorithms.

Is life a game, metaphorically speaking?

We might say no because we don't always have agency, and our goals are hazy and shifting, and the rules are never spelled out, and we may lose the _spiritus ludi_. True, but does that make life an event, or a toy, or an activity? If the conclusion is that life is an activity, we might as well have kept our mouth shut. A metaphor ought to say something interesting, relevant, informative, and clear.

For sure, life is a game to nihilists. It's navigating a labyrinth without clues. It's _maya_, an illusion.[^puns] Albert Camus relates it to Sisyphus, and there's something to that. Much of life is the labor (in the sense of Arendt) of fighting against entropy. But Camus rejects the leap of faith, too. Nor do I find it helpful to assume God has a plan, that there is meaning in everything and a Ludonomy behind it all. The book [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/) calls this stance eternalism. 

Maybe some of us can live an _Sprachspiel_, but it seems to me we need both. They are opponent processes. Life flows between them. From evolution selecting on principles to expressing itself in new species to the left and right hemispheres of the brain, both modes are built into us. What matters more is that we find flow states in the games we play. 

Games are our institutions, technologies that help us respond to chaos. It's in our nature to play. We just have to ask what.

# Appendix

## Players

We assumed good faith players throughout the essay, but it's worth reflecting on deviant player types and behavior. 


|Type|Rule-abiding|Goal-aiming|
|-----|------------------|-----------------|
|Players|Yes|Yes|
|Triflers|Yes|No|
|Cheats|No|Yes|
|Spoilsports|No|No|
[Table [Players]: Types of players]

- Players follow the rules and are aiming for the goal.
- A trifler follows the rules but isn't interested in the goal given. They're either delaying or interested in some other goal. This is not necessarily a negative.
- A cheater wants to reach the goal but breaks rules to get there. Cheaters 
- A spoilsport doesn't want to play. They neither follow the rules nor aim for the given goal. 


## Bibliography

This essay was inspired by a lot of reading and thinking, not all of which was explicitly cited. If you find these ideas interesting, follow the trail. 

- The relationship between chaos and philosophy, art, and science from Deleuze and Guattari's _What is Philosophy?_. 
- The definition of games, adapted from Bernard Suits' _The Grasshopper_, Mark Rosewater's [What Is a Game?](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/what-game-2018-06-04), and Brian Upton's _The Aesthetic of Play_, which especially helped me understand play and interpretation. 
- Thomas Pynchon's short story "Entropy"
- Nietzsche's _Beyond Good and Evil_ and _Twilight of the Idols_ for critiques of ludonomy, which tends to align with the Apollonian.
