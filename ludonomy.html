**Ludonomy**
    Ashwin Reddy

The ancients took games seriously, perhaps more seriously than us, giving them a venerated place in their stories and rituals. After Ragnarök, the Nordics say, the new gods will find artifacts in the grass -- pieces of the chesslike board game Tafl, remainders of an extinguished world. Or, in a critical moment of India's _Mahabharata_, the longest extant epic poem, the Pandavas lose their kingdom and all their possessions in a rigged game of dice, thus setting the main story in motion. Even today, the Olympics serve as a reminder that the Greeks once celebrated the name Zeus with athletic contests.

Suppose we, hoping to recover old ideals, believe games still matter. It's not so ridiculous once you remember that animals play, too. But assuming life _is_ a game, so what? Is that, in fact, good or bad? Is life then a rat race, that is, a status game? Is it navigating the labyrinth and confronting the Minotaur? Or is it a Sisyphean task? Perhaps a cold and calculated chess match, or the opposite -- a game of snakes and ladders? If life is a marathon, how long is it really? Does the modern world even agree whether the point of a game is to win or have fun? 

A useful metaphor must ground its tenor in a more concrete vehicle. But games are hardly easier to understand than life itself, so the comparison wins us nothing. _Life is a game_ is a banal, rotting aphorism which requires an essay to investigate and invigorate it.

# Define

> "That's enough about lessons," the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: "tell her something about the games now."
>                                                                           -- Lewis Carroll's _Alice in Wonderland_

Without a definition of games, we are liable to talk past one another, but I do not claim an indisputable definition. The point is to bind the word to an agreed meaning. After that, I am free to use the word liberally and with impunity.

Game
: A game $G$ consists in $n \geqslant 1$ players $\left\{P_i\right\}_{i=1}^n$ in a space $S$, each attempting to reach their goal state(s) $\Omega_{P_i}(G) \subset S$ while following rules which determine the shape of $S$, all for fun.

Chess, crossword puzzles, ultimate frisbee, video games, and other obvious examples of games conform to this definition, which rests on three or four components, depending how you count. Each component is necessary; the Ablation column below lists what a game would be without that component.

|Component|Key Phrase|Ablation|
|---------|----------|---------|
|Agency|_players ... each attempting to reach_|Event|
|Goal|_their goal states_ $\Omega_{P_i}(G)$|Toy/Sandbox|
|Restrictions/Playfulness|_following rules ... all for fun_|Activity|
[Table [components]: The ingredients of a game]

A game needs players empowered to make choices. If they lack agency, they can't make choices that dramatically shift the game's course. Then the players are not players but beings experiencing an event like a graduation ceremony or an acid trip. 

The players need a goal $\Omega(G)$, a privileged state in $S$ to reach. The $\Omega(G)$ for chess is checkmate. But the goal need not be a static arrangement of objects in $S$. It might be a mental state as in _Clue_, where the $\Omega(G)$ is knowing the details of the murder. Or it can be a physical space, like sumo wrestlers trying to stay inside the dohyo as long as possible. The $\Omega(G)$ is keeping the game going as long as possible in last-man-standing or so-called infinite games. If the player decides on his or her own goals, then the game is a toy or a sandbox like Legos.

Finally, a game needs restrictions, rules or constraints, which impose limits on $S$ but in turn open up the possibility of play. Notably, players have to affirm these rules on their own terms. Moving a bulky sofa into a new apartment is an activity that affords agency and has a goal, but it is not a game. The constraints are defined purely by the circumstances. You can't simply drag the sofa through the door because the door is not wide enough, not because there are rules which are preventing you from doing so. In contrast, the chess ruleset prevents its players from moving pieces however they like, and players subscribe to these rules for no other reason than to play chess.

We identify a game by pointing to the players, the space with a goal, and the rules.

# Telos

Definitions can't explain, and this one says nothing about the reasonable but misguided question _why do people play games?_ We'll need to introduce the notion of telos as well as instincts and institutions to reframe the question.

The telos of an object is its end or purpose. The telos of a knife is to cut. The telos of a seed is to turn into a plant. It is true that the telos of players in a single episode of a game is to reach $\Omega(G)$. But the telos of the game cannot be $\Omega(G)$. If it were, why would we have rules preventing us from getting there? The survival of the game depends on players finding the experience of the game rewarding. 

The distinction between instinct and institution made by philosopher Gilles Deleuze can help us here. An instinct directly satisfies some tendency or need of an organism. The form of the instinct depends both on that particular organism's biological state (is it hungry? is it sad?) as well as the species (bats use echolocation, but cows can't). An institution is a contrivance that also satisfies a tendency or need, providing a socially-sanctioned way of appeasing the desire. Deleuze points out that the institution in the process changes the goals: 

> So money will liberate you from hunger, provided you have money; and marriage will spare you from searching out a partner, though it subjects you to other tasks.
>

In this way, the institution is somewhat arbitrary, introducing new and questionable undertakings, even if it does quell a need. But the institution gives us a social system that "imposes a series of models on our bodies, even in its involuntary structures, and offers our intelligence a sort of knowledge, a possibility of foresight as project." Deleuze goes as far as saying that the human is an animal that replaces all its instincts with institutions. More on this later. 

The game is an institution whose telos is to satisfy the need for play. But play is itself an autotelic instinct. If a player seeks money or status or extrinsic reward, they degrade the game to activity -- a chore or labor or a means to an end. If this distinction seems straightforward, then we should wonder why it has confused so many. In "What's the Point If We Can't Have Fun?" David Graeber [asks](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun) why we're surprised to learn animals play. In a capitalist economy and hyperrational society, we tend to prioritize activities with a telos. Evolution teaches us the opposite. We should care _more_ about games because the players expend resources on something that has no obvious benefit to their survival. It must be important. 

We have created a definition that emphasizes the structure of games. But it is impoverished in that it talks about play as merely a structural constraint. Where is the sense that the players yearn for play? To expand our definition, we don't need to define play, which is impossible to pin down. Randolph Feezell gives us the sense that it is protean, at once a behavior or activity; a motive, attitude, or state of mind; a form or structure; and a meaningful experience. Rather than directly grappling with play, we will consider a game that fits the current definition, then one that doesn't, at least not as well. In attempting to unite the two kinds of games, we will have a more holistic sense for the sacred syllable _game_. 


# Solve

Optimization problems are a well-understood game in mathematics which can offer us some insight into the structure of games. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:opt}
\min_{x \in X} f(x) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad  \Big\{ g_i(x) \leq 0 \Big\}_{i=1}^n
\end{equation}

The player $P_1$ is the puzzle-solver. The space $S$ is given as $X$. The goal $\Omega(G)$ is that you have a value for the minimum $x$, and the rules are you must satisfy the $g_i$ and only use mathematically valid steps to obtain this number such that you can prove its correctness.

In its naked form, Equation \ref{eq:opt} does not look like a game, but it perfectly describes, say, a running race. The equation there is minimum time = maximum speed, optimization at its purest. Behind every game is an Equation \ref{eq:opt}, even if we couldn't write it out on paper, although often the goals, constraints, and players change in an intricate dance which cannot ever be put into symbols.

Moreover, the symbols of Equation \ref{eq:opt} bury the game's landscape. Stephen Wolfram [shows](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2022/06/games-and-puzzles-as-multicomputational-systems/) that even simple games like Tic Tac Toe exist inside an intricately structured space:

![Figure [multiway]: Wolfram's visualizations of the state spaces of simple games, demonstrating that games are computational systems.](https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/multiway-hero-final-2.png)


Wolfram focuses on games with discrete state spaces and moves. For such games, the natural visualization is a graph. Each vertex is a state and the edges represent moves from one state to another. If the game has a continuous state space, however, the better description is a manifold. 

The best example of a manifold is Earth, whose surface I can traverse continuously.[^dimensions] Just as an atlas in real life is a book of charts that allow me to navigate the earth, every manifold $M$ has a mathematical structure called an atlas $\mathscr{A}$, which contains charts $\varphi_\alpha$ that cover all of $M$. 

[^dimensions]: The Earth's surface is an example of a 2-dimensional manifold because you need sheets of paper as the charts. A 1D manifold has number lines for charts, and a 3D manifold has cubes for charts, so on and so forth; you can have manifolds in $n$ dimensions for any integer $n \geqslant 1$.


$$
\mathscr{A} = \left\{(U_\alpha, \varphi_\alpha): \alpha \in I\right\} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha = M
$$

A chart $\varphi$ takes some portion of $M$, denoted $U$, and gives it coordinates in $\mathbf{R}^n$, which are easier to work with. For Earth, $U$ could be the region of France, and $\varphi$ would assign latitude and longitude to all the points in $U$.

![Figure [earth]: Earth as a manifold, with one chart shown. Notice the flat geometry of the chart compared to the curved geometry on the surface. With enough charts, we could cover the whole surface.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Triangle_on_globe.jpg)

Critically, players don't need to keep the whole manifold in their memory to play. As long as they know where they are and where the goal is, they can make progress, tracing out just one of many possible paths in the space of the manifold.

![Figure [path]: A path on the manifold of your screen.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/Path.svg)

Path
: A trajectory in the manifold, represented by a function $f: [0, 1] \to M$. If $M$ is a graph, then a sequence of edges connecting vertices on the graph.

Using our new vocabulary, we can say that a game provides a manifold on which players trace out paths that aim to terminate in $\Omega(G)$. A succesful path is a solution to the game.

Solution
: A path that ends at $\Omega(G)$ while obeying all the constraints.

When the game is framed as such, there are only two steps to finding a solution.

1. Enumerate or represent all possible paths
2. Select the one which is optimal by some algorithm or heuristic. 

Problem solving is all about thinking in this way. For example, working backwards is finding a path by traversing from $\Omega(G)$. 

A more powerful example is Lagrangian mechanics, where we model a physical system as a game. The player is Mother Nature,[^gt] and the space is a manifold called the configuration space, which represents a physical system (e.g. mass on a spring, blocks on a ramp, etc.). We impose the following condition on Nature: at time $t_0$ the system must be in the configuration $\mathbf{q}_0$ and at time $t_1$ it must be in configuration $\mathbf{q}_1$. 

[^gt]: This is a standard practice in game theory. We say that we're modeling Nature as a pseudo-player, and the actions are called moves by Nature.

![Figure [solutions]: A homotopy of paths $\mathbf{q}(t)$, which we'll take to be trajectories that start at the same place and all end at $\Omega(G)$. The player, i.e. Nature, needs to select the optimal one.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Homotopy_between_two_paths.svg)

The laws of physics -- the word law should make you think of ludonomy here -- make only some paths possible, but which one does Nature select? She selects the optimal one as defined by

$$
\frac{\delta S}{\delta \mathbf{q}(t)} = 0, \tag{Hamilton's Principle}
$$

where this equation is analogous to finding an optimum for a function $f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$ by solving $f'(x)=0$. The quantity $S$ is called the action and it tracks the total excess energy $\mathcal{L}$, known as the Lagrangian, over the time interval.

$$
S[\mathbf{q}] \triangleq \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \mathcal{L}\big(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t)\big) \, \mathrm{d}t.
$$

A standard technique in the toolkit of physicists, Lagrangian mechanics is an application of Equation \ref{eq:opt}. 

Another example goes back to Wolfram's discrete setting. In the Tower of Hanoi problem, there are three rods with a stack of disks on the rightmost rod organized from smallest to largest going down. Your job is to transfer the disks to the leftmost rod, but without allowing a larger disk to sit on top of a smaller one. 

![Figure [Hanoi]: The Tower of Hanoi, a classic problem from introductory computer science classes. ](https://content.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/sw060722hanoiimg3.png)

If you didn't have the graph, how would you generate the solution? You can use recursion.

```Python
def printMove(fr, to):
    print(f'move from {fr} to {to}')

def towers(n, fr, to, spare):
    if n == 1:
        printMove(fr, to)
    else:
        towers(n - 1, fr, spare, to)
        towers(1, fr, to, spare)
        towers(n - 1, spare, to, fr)
```
[Listing [Recursion]: Python program to compute Hanoi solutions recursively.]

We see how effective abstract and formal reasoning can be. Given a clearly specified game, we can compute ready-to-go solutions using algebra and/or geometry. These yield paths which we can guarantee lead us to $\Omega(G)$. Taken to the extreme, a strategist or theoretician can solve a game completely.

Solved game
: A game for which we can produce solutions from any position.

A solved game is one that has submitted to our will. If you see a game and realize that, fundamentally, it's a game which you know is solved, then you will always be the winner. But only when we can formalize the game like this is it possible to solve the game, so we need a word to refer to a game's mathematical structure.

Ludonomy[^ety-ludonomy]
: The game as it appears when it is formalized, that is, expressed through logical propositions, enabling it to be represented and solved mathematically.

Ludonomers are logicians, computer scientists, mathematicians, philosophers, and lawyers, fluent in the rules and their implications. This is remarkable but also bittersweet. If the game is solved, then people will stop playing it. Adults know how to force a draw in Tic Tac Toe, hence only children play it. 

Remember this about ludonomy, if nothing else: it is where we take up the mantle of Shiva and by solving games, put them to rest. New games emerge where old ones are buried. We go on to construct games for which we must become better, faster, stronger.

[^ety-ludonomy]: Formed from Latin _ludus_ meaning game and Greek _nomos_ meaning law, custom, or rule.

# Language

> "Our language can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses."
>                               -- Wittgenstein

Perhaps no mathematician loved games and play as much as Lewis Carroll, author of _Alice in Wonderland_ (1865) and its sequel _Through the Looking-Glass_ (1871). When he wasn't writing about Euclidean geometry and logic or finding recursive ways to compute determinants, he was writing poetry and novels and designing puzzles.

In _Through the Looking-Glass_, the great philosopher of language, the egghead Humpty Dumpty, unknowingly reveals to Alice that conversations are turn-based games.

> "In that case we start fresh,” said Humpty Dumpty, 
> “and it’s my turn to choose a subject—” (“He talks about it just as if it was a game!” thought Alice.)
>                                                   

Alice stops short of calling the conversation a game, but we can supply the syllogism for her. In a conversation, two or more players are operating in the space either of ideas or words. They have agency insofar as they can say something which will advance the conversation, that is, move it in some direction. The goal is to keep the conversation interesting for all players as long as they can. There must be rules because you cannot just say anything in a conversation, and Paul Grice tells us what they are.

|Maxim|Directive|Meaning|
|----|---------|--------|
|Quantity|Be informative|Say as much as you need but no more than that.|
|Quality|Be truthful|Don't say what is false or lacking in reason.|
|Relation|Be relevant|Stay on topic.|
|Manner|Be clear|Be brief and orderly; avoid ambiguity and obscurity.|
[Table [Grice]: Grice's Maxims tell us four principles that (good) conversationalists follow.]

We showed that a conversation has Ludonomy, but it shares almost no similarities with the examples in sec. [Solve]. The path of a conversation is completely abstract and can't be reasonably represented in a mathematical structure. Consequently, I can't point to an $\Omega(G)$ in that space nor can I predict what you would say or where the conversation will go. In short, there's no solution to a conversation. To play it is to experience it. Therefore, any conception of games relying solely on ludonomy is insufficient. There must be another side to games which can capture the gamelike aspect of conversation. 

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein coined the term _Sprachspiel_ (German for language-game) in his book _Philosophical Investigations_ to talk about such games, which include

> 
> - Giving order ands obeying them
> - Describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements
> - Constructing an object from a description (a drawing)
> - Reporting an event
> - Speculating about an event
> - Forming and testing a hypothesis
> - Presenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams
> - Making up a story; and reading it
> - Play-acting
> - Singing catches
> - Guessing riddles
> - Making a joke; telling it
> - Solving a problem in practical arithmetic
> - Translating from one language to another
> - Asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.
>

If we want to unify Ludonomy and _Sprachspiel_, we need some common basis. However, _Sprachspiele_ resist a simple mathematical structure. We can take the reverse approach: force mathematics into language.

Take chess, a ludonomous game. I can write down a particular game as a series of moves in the algebraic notation. If I had a sheet with these moves to someone, they might tell me who the players were, or why such and such move was interesting. What this tells me is that the notation concisely captures the information of the game. Every game has a _Sprachspiel_, which spectators and commentators are the first to notice, but the more ludonomous the game, the more the formalization does the work rather than the spectator.

Despite the fact that chess is so rigorously structured, different players have different styles, and the meta-game has changed over time. This is another way in which every game has _Sprachspiel_. Since players have agency, they can express their personality in their choices in and approach to the game. 

# Academics

|Ludonomy|_Sprachspiel_|
|--------|--------------|
|Ludonomy is the enclosed institution of the game with a clear goal. It requires concentration and careful analysis of rules. It sees the game as a puzzle and wants us to use our mind and learning to uncover the structure and come to an objective answer. It wants everything laid out in a hierarchical manner so that we, the players, can see what its purpose is and then exploit its advantages. Once we see all things in a stable coherence, we can find the optimal trajectory and simply follow it.|_Sprachspiel_ is about the outward-looking instinct and language of play. It wants to feel how the world is laid out over time and space, not to comprehend it in one gulp. It wanders around the space, hoping to see what is curious and interesting, what defies expectation. It orients itself towards the aesthetic. It asks whether a thing has a use which hasn't been considered yet. It like intuition and creating new things out of old ones. The _Sprachspieler_ digs for Pluto's sparkling gems in the earthy soil.|

Every game has a Ludonomy which persists while we sense there are rules, and a _Sprachspiel_ which enables the game to be an institution and not just the fancy of an individual. However, different games are positioned at different points on the spectrum between the two. In particular, we focus here on the disciplines of _Wissenschaft_, collective knowledge.

*                                     
****************************************************************

We draw a box for Ludonomy because it can swallow games and an arrow for _Sprachspiel_ because it can extend indefinitely. 

Remember, each discipline is a game. On its own, we can doubt what it has to tell us. A typical philosophy paper can't and won't bring in a mathematical perspective. A work of art usually doesn't do the science it references justice. But the principle of consilience tells us that if fields with different operating assumptions and techniques converge on the same conclusions, we should believe that conclusion more.

## Math

> "Mathematics is a game played according to certain simple rules with meaningless marks on paper"
>                                                                       -- David Hilbert

Technical papers in pure mathematics are a sequence of definitions, lemmas, theorems, and proofs. They leave you to develop the intuition; the paper's purpose is to lay out the facts. Clearly heavy on Ludonomy and light on _Sprachspiel_, language is still needed to communicate the ideas from writer to reader. Grice's Maxims are still in play: the paper needs to say something interesting, relevant, and informative in a clear way. And one needs a sense of adventure and curiosity in mathematics as well. 

## Science

Science pursues explanations in the natural world, or what amounts to the same thing, discovering the rules of Nature's game. Given observations of how the game has turned out, can we say what the Ludonomy of the game is? The Nobel laureate Richard Feynman described science as a game:

> "There are a number of special techniques associated with the game of making observations,
> and much of what is called the philosophy of science is concerned with a discussion of these techniques.
> The interpretation of a result is an example. To take a trivial instance, there is a famous joke about a man
> who complains to a friend of a mysterious phenomenon. The white horses on his farm eat more than the black horses.
> He worries about this and cannot understand it, until his friend suggests that maybe he has more white horses than black ones."
>                                                                                   

On the one hand, Wittgenstein says speculating about an event and dealing with hypotheses are _Sprachspiel_. The farmer is also clearly communicating with his friend to interpret the results. On the other hand, the basic inference (more white horses -> white horses eat more) is a trivial example of Ludonomy. 

The explanations in science ought to follow Grice's maxims as well: they should be interesting, relevant, informative, and clear. One paper which tries to tether the Ludonomy and _Sprachspiel_ of explanations is [#Wojtowicz20]. 

## Philosophy

> "[Philosophy] forms and constructs the mind, lays down life, rules actions, shows what is to be done and what is to be left out, it sits at the helm and directs the course through the uncertainties of hesitating." 
>                           -- Seneca

A serious discussion about what philosophy is would take up a book of its own. All that must be said is that philosophy's tendency toward logic and uncovering the structure of things pulls it toward Ludonomy while its conversational and creative nature pushes it toward _Sprachspiel_. If we want to prevent ourselves from minimizing its value, we need to stop ourselves from allowing it to slip all the way to Ludonomy. The goal of philosophy is not to create a totalizing framework in which everything is given a narrow purpose. Rather, philosophy has to invent concepts and tell us what games are worth playing as well as how to play them. 

## Art

> "Regarding truths, the artist has a weaker morality than the thinker. He definitely does not want to be deprived of the splendid and profound interpretations of life, and he resists sober, simple methods and results."
>                       -- Nietzsche

By art, I mean creating art, understanding it, and critiquing it, whether it be writing, drawing, painting, sculpting, singing, etc. Of course, we see a great sense of play in Picasso and Dali. We love artists who revolutionize the game around their own style. Undoubtedly, artists have the agency to put elements together on the canvas, in the marble, or whatever their medium is. The goal of a piece of art is never clear, but the artist must follow certain rules in order to create something meaningful. 

I have to thank Brian Upton's _The Aesthetic of Play_ for showing me that understanding and critiquing art is also a game. Reading a literary book or watching a cinematic movie is a game because you have to choose how to take in what you're seeing. If you skip to the end of the book or movie, you didn't "win." The point is to follow a path in the space of imagination. In some sense, this path is fixed because the concrete materials of the artwork don't change. But the experience of the path _is_ different for different viewers. There are better and worst readers and viewers.  

# Interpretations

Earlier, we mentioned that Deleuze thinks humans have replaced their instincts with institutions. There is truth in this sentiment. Children are new to the world and have to learn to interpret everything around them. By the time they become adults, they are acclimated to the institutions around them and forget they have a constant habit of interpreting. Much of the time, they are on autopilot. When one learns to play a new game or play a new instrument or reads a foreign language, one is forced to see how bad their interpretation is. 

Remember this. The Stoics remind us that, though we can't change what we sense, we _choose_ to assent to them. A Buddhist meditation practice will reveal the same. Most of our sensory experiences are mediated through one game (i.e. theory) or another. You go to work, you speak to a friend, you watch a movie -- you had to be trained to do all these things. Likewise, every academic discipline or sport or occupation draws its own frame for intepreting the subject of its study, and it provides the tools for interacting with and making sense of those subjects. 

The ubiquity of interpretation can come back to bite us. In Susan Sontag's essay "Against Interpretation," she points out one way in which Ludonomy and Sprachspiel can rub up against one another. Paraphrasing, suppose you have reason to believe that within some game there is the Truth. The ready example is a religious believer looking at scripture. The believer looks at a passage and finds themselves confused by the meaning or the sense of it. At this point, the believer is going to enter a special _Sprachspiel_ of interpreting the work. They are going to use some parts of the text and perhaps exogenous evidence to construct a new meaning for the passage that no longer confuses them. They are going to construct a latent ludonomy, in which _A_ really means _B_, etc. This is what happens in a close reading in a literature class. The problem is, none of this work is useful. 

Interpretation is useful when you've already got some set of rules in hand, but you are seeing phenomena which are not directly explained by the rules. This gap is called emergence. Andrew Assad and Norman H. Packard define emergence in terms of how easily one can deduce the behavior from the rules. 

|Category|Meaning|
|---------|-------|
|Non-emergent|Behavior is immediately deducible upon inspection of the specification or rules generating it.|
|Weakly emergent|Behavior is deducible in hindsight from the specification after observing the behavior.|
|Strongly emergent|Behavior is deducible in theory, but its elucidation is prohibitively difficult.|
|Maximally emergent|Behavior is impossible to deduce from the specification.|
[Table [Emergence]: Scales of emergence.]

We're used to reduction, which is taking a complex system and using ludonomy (science and math) to break it down into its parts. Emergence is the power of _Sprachspiel_. Game designers are trying to create emergent systems for you to play.

# Chaos/Entropy

There is a more subversive way of talking about the relationship between games, interpretation, and emergence. It's Chaos and Entropy. We'll begin with the technical sense of these words. 

Chaos theory examines deterministic systems which exhibit local predictability with long-term unpredictability. Take a double pendulum.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Double-compound-pendulum.gif)

It moves smoothly, as you would expect. But the path it traces out is unpredictable, even at a mathematical level. In this way, chaos theorists have found that math, the ultimate ludonomy, can undermine its own capabilities.[^godel] The famous Lorenz equations are simple enough to be memorized in a few minutes, but they generate a chaotic system as well.

[^godel]: I would try to include Godel's theorem here as well, but I don't understand it well enough. Perhaps it is worth pointing to the reader to [Münchhausen trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma?oldformat=true), though.

A related but distinct concept is entropy. Unfortunately, the word is highly overloaded. In thermodynamics, entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system, and the entropy of a closed system goes up over time. In information theory, entropy looks mathematically the same, but it represents probabilistic surprise. Thermodynamic entropy is the reason our bodies constantly expend energy counteracting natural deterioration. Information entropy is the reason why redundancy is baked into language.[^pynchon]

[^pynchon]: For a literary investigation with strong philosophical flavor of both these concepts, try Thomas Pynchon's short story "Entropy."


Principle of maximum entropy
: Of all the valid distributions that could model your system, select the one with the highest entropy.

This is because entropy reflects information; to select something other than maximum entropy is to assume you know something you don't. Let's think about an everyday example.

A story needs some amount of predictability. If the character in each scene randomly change personality, we would be confused. If it ends in _deus ex machina_, we feel cheated. By definition, it goes against the tendency of the plot until that point. On the other hand, the story can't be completely predictable. If someone tells you that their day started when they brushed their teeth and put on their socks, you become bored. A good story is one where the information flows together, but it ends up somewhere interesting, remarkable, _unexpected_.

We've only recently started to acknowledge emergence, chaos, and entropy. Nassim Taleb has done great work here with _Black Swan_ and _Antifragile_, which are books that make space for what we don't know and why we need chaos. Taleb has a broad catalogue of chaos which is useful to keep in mind.

# Autonomous Intelligence

In his series [Awakening from the Meaning Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ), John Vervaeke discusses how cognitive science and philosophy can help us understand human wisdom and meaning in life. He calls his work Relevance Realization. Humans are intelligent, he says, because they know how to filter out irrelevant information. If, however, we fixate on the wrong variables in a situation, we get stuck. It is important that we each have the capacity for both Ludonomy and _Sprachspiel_. We can't survive without both. 

I think we're seeing these come together in modern artificial intelligence. [#Ma22] in particular proposes that we have two values, which I believe correspond to the two kinds of games.


||Self-Consistency|Parsimony|
|---|----------------|---------|
|Motive|How to learn|What to learn|
|Question|How to compute the solution?|What's the right way to frame the problem?|
|Field|Game Theory|Information Theory|
|Game|Ludonomy|_Sprachspiel_|
[Table [Learning-Values]: Two principles for learning.]


_Sprachspiel_ has the ability to discover what is relevant. It is parsimony embodied. Jorge Luis Borges' short story "On Exactitude in Science" treats of a country which attempted to make a full-sized map that coincided point-for-point with the space it represents. This is Ludonomy, hoping that its manifold is complete. But, as Borges points out, such a manifold is useless because it doesn't focus our attention. The job of a map is to simplify the world so we can navigate. His short story "The Library of Babel" concerns a library with all possible books in it. This, too, is a ludonomous idea, that the truth exists in the bounds of a system. But the point here is that we need humans to explore the space and interpret it to discover truth. 


Papers like [#Lampinen21] and [#Liu22] show that systems of autonomous intelligence do better when they incorporate language-based explanations (a _Sprachspiel_) into the algorithm.

Is life a game, metaphorically speaking?

We might say no because we don't always have agency, and our goals are hazy and shifting, and the rules are never spelled out, and we may lose the _spiritus ludi_. True, but does that make life an event, or a toy, or an activity? The metaphor ought to reveal a new quality to life.

Life is a game, to nihilists. It's navigating a labyrinth without clues. It's _Maya_, an _illusion_ which literally means being in a game. Albert Camus relates it to Sisyphus. There's something to that. Hannah Arendt talks about labor, the things we have to do everyday just to keep ourselves functioning. Sisyphus would be a dull boy, indeed. But Camus rejects suicide as a solution.

The opposite is to assume God has a plan, that there is meaning in everything and a Ludonomy behind it all. The book [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/) calls this stance eternalism. Camus rejects this, too. It's difficult to see how one could live like that in the modern day.

Some of us could live life as an eternal _Sprachspiel_, but it seems to me we need both. They are opponent processes. Life flows between them. From evolution selecting on principles to expressing itself in new species to the left and right hemispheres of the brain, both modes are built into us. What matters more is that we find flow states in the games we play. The games are our institutions, technologies that help us respond to chaos. 

Immanuel Kant asked three questions. We ask the same ones with new language.

|Kant|Us|
|----|---|
|What can I know?|What are the rules of the game?|
|What must I do?|What is the goal?|
|What may I hope?|How shall I play?|
[Table [Kant]: Our questions.]


1. Know the rules of the game. If it's not in your control, don't worry about it.
2. Know what's relevant.
3. If a ludonomy, enumerate your options. Selecting from an unknown set is difficult.
4. If a _Sprachspiel_, explore and build up a map of the landscape. 

# Appendix

We assumed good players throughout this essay, but there are three kinds of non-standard players.

|Type|Rule-abiding|Goal-aiming|
|-----|------------------|-----------------|
|Players|Yes|Yes|
|Triflers|Yes|No|
|Cheats|No|Yes|
|Spoilsports|No|No|
