                    data-bs-content="Eliot added these notes to the New York edition published by Boni & Liveright in December 1922, apparently at the request of Liveright, who wanted to bulk out the volume. “The notes to The Waste Land! I had intended at first only to put down all the references for my earlier quotations, with a view to spiking the guns of critics of my earlier poems who had accused me of plagiarism. Then, when it came to print The Waste Land as a little book . . . it was discovered that the poem was inconveniently short, so I set to work to expand the notes, in order to provide a few more pages of printed matter, with the result that they became the remarkable exposition of bogus scholarship that is still on view today. I have sometimes thought of getting rid of these notes; but now they can never be unstuck. They have had almost greater popularity than the poem itself -- anyone who bought my book of poems, and found that the Notes to The Waste Land were not in it, would demand his money back . . . My notes stimulated the wrong kind of interest among the seekers of sources. It was just, no doubt, that I should have payed tribute to the work of Miss Jessie Weston; but I regret having sent so many enquirers off on a wild goose chase after Tarot cards and the Holy Grail” (“The Frontiers of Criticism” (1956), in T.S. Eliot, On Poetry and Poets (1957), pp. 109-10)."

            <p>Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested
                by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend: <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/From_Ritual_to_Romance"><i>From Ritual to Romance</i></a> (Cambridge). Indeed,
                so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than
                my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think
                such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in
                general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean <i>The Golden Bough</i>; I have used
                especially the two volumes <i>Adonis, Attis, Osiris</i>. Anyone who is acquainted with these works will
                immediately recognize in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.</p>

                    obviously departed to suit my own convenience. The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack,
                    fits my purpose in two ways: because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer, and
                    because I associate him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V.
                    The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear later; also the “crowds of people,” and Death by Water
                    is executed in Part IV. The Man with Three Staves (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I

                    218. Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a “character,” is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias. What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem. The whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest: <br>

                    “In the afternoon we were in a barge, watching the games on the river. (The queen) was alone with Lord Robert and myself on the poop, when they began to talk nonsense, and went so far that Lord Robert at last said, as I was on the spot there was no reason why they should not be married if the queen pleased.”

The complete text of the Buddha's Fire Sermon (which corresponds in importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which these words are taken, will be found translated in the late Henry Clarke Warren's <i>Buddhism in Translation</i> (Harvard Oriental Series). Mr. Warren was one of the great pioneers of Buddhist studies in the Occident.

                    309. From St. Augustine's <i>Confessions</i> again. The collocation of these two representatives of eastern and western ascetism, as the culmination of this part of the poem, is not an accident.

                V. What the Thunder Said</p>
            In the first part of Part V three themes are employed: the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous (see Miss Weston's book) and the present decay of eastern Europe.

                <li>357. This is <i>Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii</i>, the hermit-thrush which I have heard in Quebec County. Chapman says (<i>Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America</i>) “it is most at home in secluded woodland and thickety retreats... Its notes are not remarkable for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and exquisite modulation they are unequalled.” Its “water-dripping song” is justly celebrated.</li>
                <li>360. The following lines were stimulated by the account of one of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one of Shackleton's): it was related that the party of explorers, at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was one more member than could actually be counted.</li>
                <li>
                    366-376. Cf. Hermann Hesse, <i>Blick ins chaos</i>:
                    “Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligem Wahn am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hört sie mit Tränen.”

                    401. “Datta, dayadhvam, damyata” (Give, sympathise, control). The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found in the <i>Brihadaranyaka—Upanishad</i>, 5, 1. A translation is found in Deussen's <i>Sechsig Upanishads des Veda</i>, p. 489.

                    Also F. H. Bradley, <i>Appearance and Reality</i>, p. 306. <br>
                    “My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my feelings. In either case my experience falls within my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround it... In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul, the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.”
